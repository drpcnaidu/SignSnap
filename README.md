# SignSnap
"SignSnap" captures stylus input from an Android device to control a PC. Using Android Studio, create an app to send stylus data, and a Python server to receive it and simulate mouse movements with pyautogui. Connect both devices to the same Wi-Fi, run the app and server, and test the functionality.
